This is the repository for the second interview problem: Particle Flow Filter and Differentiable Particle Filter. It is organized as follows.

- **A report for the problems**
- **code for part 1**
- **code for part 2**
- **code for bonus questions**

<span style="color:blue">**Implementation Progress:** Part one algorithms implemented, did not have time to reproduce the test in the paper for the particle flow particle filter and particle flow filter </span>  
<span style="color:blue">**Testing Progress:** In progress, learning the framework</span>  
<span style="color:blue">**Report Progress:** Derived and understood the part one algorithms, can see the motivation for later part.  </span>
