This is the repository for the second interview problem: Particle Flow Filter and Differentiable Particle Filter. It is organized as follows.

- **A report for the problems**
- **code for part 1**
- **code for part 2**
- **code for bonus questions**

**Implementation Progress:** Part one algorithms implemented, did not have time to reproduce the test in the paper for the particle flow particle filter and particle flow filter  
**Testing Progress:** In progress, learning the framework
**Report Progress:** Derived and understood the part one algorithms, can see the motivation for later part.
